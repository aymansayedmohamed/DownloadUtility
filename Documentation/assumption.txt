I assume that : 
   - The program will take a list of sources with a different protocol .
   - The sources format will be string separated by a comma.
   - the program will download the files to a local directory. 
   - The program should be extensible to support different protocols.
   - some sources might be very big (more than memory).
   - some sources might be very slow, while others might be fast.
   - some sources might fail in the middle of download so partially downloaded files will be deleted.
   - The downloaded files will be with status (Ready for processing).
   - will be a frontend application to view the downloaded files with status (Ready for processing) and then approve or reject it.
   - The frontend application should be dynamic and should allow viewing the following kinds of files (images, text, and web pages i.e. HTML).
